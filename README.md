## Notes

SportsGameOdds response shapes can vary by market. This bot uses flexible parsing for common `byBookmaker`, `odds`, and `markets` structures. If logs show events but `Total odds rows loaded: 0`, paste one full event object so the extractor can be adjusted to your plan's exact response shape.
